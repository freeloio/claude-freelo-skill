# Remove a task label from a task

Load when the user asks to remove a task label from a task.

Freelo has **two independent label entities** that are easy to confuse:

| | Project Labels | Task Labels |
|---|---|---|
| ID type | **integer** | **UUID** |
| Scope | Defined per project | Global pool (shared across tasks) |
| Colors | From whitelist only (see API Basics) | From whitelist only |
| How to use | Set up at project level | Apply directly to a task |

> **Important:** Adding a label "by name" to a task **does not** link to a project label with the same name — it creates a **new task label** in the global pool with default color `#77787a` (grey). The two systems are decoupled.
